This project implements a Face Emotion Detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in Python. The system detects facial expressions and categorizes emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, etc., based on a dataset of labeled facial expressions.

Features
Emotion Recognition: Recognizes and categorizes various emotions from facial expressions.
Real-time Analysis: Utilizes live video feed or image input for real-time emotion detection.
Deep Learning: Built with TensorFlow/Keras for training and predicting emotions using CNNs.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
Numpy
Matplotlib
Install all requirements with:
pip install tensorflow opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
Dataset
The model was trained on the Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Dataset. Download and place the dataset in the specified directory.
